**Sonar** (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a tool that uses sound waves to detect and locate objects underwater. It's used in a variety of applications, including oceanography, commercial fishing, and military operations. 

How it works
A transducer emits sound waves into the water 
If an object is in the path of the sound waves, they bounce off and return to the transducer 
The time difference between the emitted and reflected sound waves is measured 
The distance between the transducer and the object is calculated using the speed of sound in water 


Types of sonar 
Active sonar: Transmits sound waves and receives the reflected echoes
Passive sonar: Uses only receivers to analyze the reflected sound waves


Uses of sonar 
Oceanography: Mapping the seafloor, searching for shipwrecks, and developing nautical charts
Military: Detecting submarines
Commercial fishing: Detecting and locating fish
Safe diving: Detecting underwater hazards
